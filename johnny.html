          "<a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny_Silverhand" target="_blank" id="tribute-link"><b>Johnny Silverhand</b></a>, born Robert John Linder, was a famous and influential rockerboy and lead singer of the band Samurai before its breakup in 2008. A military veteran who defined the rockerboy movement as it is known today, Silverhand was the most prominent figure who fought against the corrupted NUSA government and megacorporations, often being described as a terrorist because of this. Despite being charismatic and quite the charmer, he was also known to be irrational, impulsive, and manipulative.

Silverhand got his nickname from the silvery bionic left arm he had implanted after losing his actual arm in the Second Central American War. Most probably one of the early victims of cyberpsychosis as a result, he then became very temperamental and "on the edge." He is described in one interview as having been driven by "dedication and ambitions, but at the end of the day, he doesn't care much for the people around him as long as they are used to accomplish his goals."

Eventually, Silverhand was killed by Adam Smasher during the Night City Holocaust on August 20th, 2023. However, his consciousness was saved as an engram and stored on a Relic after his encounter with Smasher, but just prior to his bodily death. The engram is not Silverhand's actual consciousness, but instead a digital replication of his personality which, when copied onto Relic 2.0, is engineered to overwrite itself onto its host like a virus."
